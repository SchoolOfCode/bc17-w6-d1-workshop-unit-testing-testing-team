Within app.test.js, plan and write test cases/scenarios for the following functions:
calculateRoundResult - you should have a test for each permutation of valid inputs and assert that it returns the correct value
calculateRoundResult - you should have a few tests for a few invalid inputs too and assert that it throws an error with the correct message
calculateNewScores - you should test different score objects with different outcomes and assert that the correct value is returned
generateComputerMove - you should have tests that verify and assert that the function can return either rock, paper or scissors.
